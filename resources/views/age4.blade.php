        <h3>Children with age between 7-15 months</h3>
        <p>Around 7 months, it begins the transition from three to two day sleeps. The biological hours for the two day sleeps are 9a.m. and 1p.m., with a night sleep at 3 hours after waking up from the last day sleep. During the transition period, however, the second sleep may start earlier or be shorter. On those days, provide a third sleep from which the baby will wake up at 4:30p.m. the latest, to protect the evening bedtime hour. The two day sleeps program has 3 activity intervals, the first of them is 2 hours long(from waking up in the morning until the first sleep of the day), the second is 2 and a half hours long(between morning and noon sleep) and the third one is 3 hours long (from last day sleep to night bedtime).</p>
